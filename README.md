#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
Software engineering is the systematic application of engineering principles to the design, development, testing, and maintenance of software. It aims to create reliable and scalable software solutions within time and budget constraints.
Importance in the Tech Industry:

    - Ensures high-quality software products.

    - Enables collaboration among developers and stakeholders.

    - Reduces software development time and cost.

    - Facilitates maintainability and scalability.

Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
    - 1968 NATO Conference – Marked the recognition of the “software crisis,” leading to the formalization of software engineering as a discipline.

    - Introduction of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) – Languages like C++ and Java revolutionized software design and development by promoting modularity and reuse.

    - Agile Manifesto (2001) – Introduced Agile methodology, which emphasized collaboration, flexibility, and iterative development.

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
    - Requirement Analysis – Gathering functional and non-functional requirements.

    - System Design – Architecture, technologies, and specifications are defined.

    - Implementation (Coding) – Actual code development begins.

    - Testing – Ensures the software meets the expected standards.

    - Deployment – The product is released to users.

    - Maintenance – Ongoing support and updates to fix bugs or improve features.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
| Feature    | Waterfall                            | Agile                                              |
|------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------|
| Approach   | Linear and sequential                | Iterative and incremental                          |
| Flexibility| Rigid, hard to change                | Highly adaptable to changes                        |
| Testing    | After implementation                 | Continuous testing                                 |
| Best for   | Well-defined, fixed-scope projects   | Evolving, user-focused, fast-paced projects        |

Waterfall: Building firmware for hardware (fixed requirements).

Agile: Developing a web/mobile app with frequent user feedback.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
Software Developer: Designs, writes, tests, and maintains code.

Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer: Ensures software meets standards via testing and validation.

Project Manager: Oversees planning, coordination, and execution of the project to ensure timely delivery.

Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
IDEs (Integrated Development Environments): Tools that combine code editor, compiler, debugger, etc.

    Examples: Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, Eclipse.

    Importance: Improves productivity, supports debugging, and provides syntax highlighting.

VCS (Version Control Systems): Manage code changes and collaboration.

    Examples: Git, GitHub, GitLab.

    Importance: Tracks history, enables collaboration, supports rollback.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
Scope Creep: Requirements keep changing.
Strategy: Use change management and define scope clearly.

Debugging Complex Issues: Hard to trace bugs.
Strategy: Use unit tests and logging.

Collaboration Barriers: Miscommunication in teams.
Strategy: Regular meetings, clear documentation, use tools like Slack/Jira.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
    Unit Testing – Tests individual components (e.g., functions, classes).

    Integration Testing – Tests interaction between modules.

    System Testing – Tests the entire system as a whole.

    Acceptance Testing – Validates the system against user requirements.

Importance: Ensures each part of the application works correctly and meets user expectations, reducing the risk of bugs in production.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering

Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
Prompt engineering is the practice of crafting clear and effective inputs (prompts) to guide AI models (like ChatGPT) toward producing accurate, relevant, and useful outputs.

Importance:

    Determines the quality of AI responses.

    Reduces ambiguity and bias.

    Helps in automating workflows using AI.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
    Vague Prompt: “Tell me something about AI.”

    Improved Prompt: “Explain what artificial intelligence is, give two real-world applications, and describe how it differs from machine learning.”

Why the Improved Prompt Works:

    It's clear and specific about what information is needed.

    Guides the AI to stay focused and avoid irrelevant answers.

    Results in a more structured and useful response.
